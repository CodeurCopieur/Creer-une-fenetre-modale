            <p>Yeah, lots of people did. No! Don't jump! Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Kids have names? Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged. Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch. Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket.</p>
            <p>There's one way and only one way to determine if an animal is intelligent. Dissect its brain! I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0. <strong>8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!</strong> <em> Fry!</em> Quit doing the right thing, you jerk!</p>
            <h2>We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised.</h2>
            <p>Throw her in the brig. Okay, I like a challenge. No! The cat shelter's on to me. Who are those horrible orange men? One hundred dollars.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want!</li>
                <li>Oh yeah, good luck with that.</li>
                <li>How much did you make me?</li>

            <h3>No, just a regular mistake.</h3>
            <p>I wish! It's a nickel. Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Is that a cooking show? Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. And when we woke up, we had these bodies.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pansy.</li>
                <li>Oh, I think we should just stay friends.</li>
                <li>Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!</li>

            <p>It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. Ooh, name it after me!</p>
            <p>You are the last hope of the universe. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! A sexy mistake.</p>
            <p>Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to interfere in his life. Tell them I hate them. There's no part of that sentence I didn't like! Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite loop, and he's an idiot! Well, that's love for you.</p>
            <p>Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!</p>
            <p>I feel like I was mauled by Jesus. You guys go on without me! I'm going to go… look for more stuff to steal! Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>
            <p>Bender, quit destroying the universe! Leela's gonna kill me. They're like sex, except I'm having them! Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be…</p>
            <p>Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? No, just a regular mistake. All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school!</p>
            <p>It must be wonderful. You can see how I lived before I met you. I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?</p>
            <p>Oh, I always feared he might run off like this. Why, why, why didn't I break his legs? I don't want to be rescued. There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!</p>
            <p>Daddy Bender, we're hungry. Noooooo! We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay!</p>
            <p>Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Oh God, what have I done? Really?! Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Can I use the gun? Well, then good news! It's a suppository.</p>
